However, this generality comes at a price. Both parameter inference and filtering are challenging when using these models, and unfortunately, real-time forecasting combines both of these tasks into one.\nIn this talk, I provide a high-level overview of the algorithms that are available for this task, and I describe the three-way tradeoff between bias, variance and computational cost. I then introduce, in a non-technical way, the particle swarm filter, and provide an example on “pricing” options on the S\u0026P 500 index.","tags":[],"title":"Real-Time Bayesian Forecasting with State-Space Models","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Taylor R.

We describe why the pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, used in this setting, is an effective strategy for parameter estimation.  The flexibility of this approach allows for general priors to be put on both the missing covariates and the parameters, uses all of the available data, can easily be extended to handle a nonignorable missing-data mechanism, and is still asymptotically exact like most other Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques.  We discuss computing strategies, conduct a simulation study demonstrating how standard errors change as a function of percent missingness, and we use our approach on a 'real-world' data set to describe how a collection of variables influence the car crash outcomes.","tags":[],"title":"Estimating generalized linear models with the pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings algorithm","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Taylor R.

They possess a latent low-dimensional random process to help explain a higher-dimensional vector of finacial returns. This hidden process can represent anything the investor deems pertinent Despite being expressive models in this class are exceedingly difficult to estimate. Within a Bayesian framework Gibbs sampling is the most common approach yet this is only available for some models used along with certain priors. Variants of Metropolis-Hastings are theoretically justified however they do not mix well in practice. We argue that Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques a newer set of likehood-free MCMC algorithms are well-suited to this task. We describe the general principles of the algorithm strategies for parallelization and show some examples of estimating different models. We also demonstrate once these models are estimated their out-of-sample forecasting performance.
